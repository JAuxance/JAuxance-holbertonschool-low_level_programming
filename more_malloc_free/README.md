# More malloc and free

In this project, you will continue to learn about the use of `malloc` and `free` in C. You will learn about the different types of memory allocation that exist, how to use them, and how to free them up when they are no longer needed.

The project will cover the following concepts:

* Dynamic memory allocation
* Memory allocation types
* Memory deallocation
* Use of `free` and `malloc` together
* Use of `calloc` and `realloc`
